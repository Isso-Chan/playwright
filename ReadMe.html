This hybrid framework was created to execute both TestNG and cucumber tests


There is a TESTRUNNER package for runners. To execute;
    - TestNG tests: can be executed by running "testng-resgressions.xml". It enables parallel testing
    - Cucumber tests:
        - They can be executed by running "CucumberTestsRunner" class. Runs tests one-by-one
        - By using maven -> mvn verify. This will enables parallel testing


There is only one target folder for RESULTS.
    -TestNG test results will be saved under "target/TestNGTestsResults/".
    -There are 2 alternatives for Cucumber test results.
        - If tests are executed by starting on "CucumberTestsRunner" class, then just a default-html-report
          file will be generated under target folder
        - If tests are executed By using maven, then they will be saved under "target/CucumberTestsReports/"
