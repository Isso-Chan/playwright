This hybrid framework was created to execute both TestNG and cucumber tests


There is a TESTRUNNER package for runners.
    - All tests (TestNG and Cucumber together): can be executed by running "testng-resgressions.xml". It enables parallel testing
    - Just Cucumber tests:
        - They were also added in testng-resgressions.xml file and can be executed together with TestNG tests
        - They can be executed by running "CucumberTestsRunner" class. (Runs tests one-by-one)
        - By using maven -> "mvn verify". This will enables parallel testing as well.


There is only one target folder for RESULTS.
    -All tests (TestNG and Cucumber together) results will be saved under "target/TestNGTestsResults/".
    -There are 2 alternatives for Cucumber test results.
        - If tests are executed by starting on "CucumberTestsRunner" class, then just a cucumbertests-html-report
          file will be generated under target folder
        - If tests are executed By using maven command, then they will be saved under "target/CucumberTestsReports/"
            In case of failing scenario, rerun.txt file will be generated under target folder.
            These failing ones can be executed again just by running FailedCukesTestsRunner class again.
            After execution, failedCucumberTests.html file will be generated just for re-executed tests under target folder.
